  \section*{Professional Experience}

    \subsection*{Personal Projects}

      \textbf{Bus Time}~--- available \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.ming13.bustime}{on Google Play} \\

        The timetable for the city where I live in as an Android application.
        The very first version did not have any ready-to-use information so the app
        had the ability to edit timetables and sync them via
        \href{https://dropbox.com}{Dropbox}. The current version contains
        the information users need in a pretty form. I designed and developed
        it by myself, as well as collected information about buses because Novopolotsk
        does not have any centralized API for obtaining it. \\

      \textbf{Gambit}~--- available \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.ming13.gambit}{on Google Play}
        and \href{https://github.com/ming13/gambit}{GitHub} \\

        Android application for learning foreign languages
        (and other things if you want) using flashcards.
        The first version of the application had the ability of
        \href{https://drive.google.com}{Google Drive} sync, the current version
        does not support it because of API changes. I designed and developed
        it myself as well. It is an open-source software, so you could read the code
        \href{https://github.com/ming13/gambit}{on GitHub} and understand
        how I prefer to organize Android application development in practice.

    \subsection*{University, Freelance and Open Source}

      The most noticeable course works at the university were the writing of
      \href{https://github.com/ming13/aequatio}{a mathematical tool}
      using C++ and Qt and a RESTful web-server using Python,
      SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL and Flask. \\

      As a freelancer I wrote some Android applications, the last one was
      a client for a hosting provider using their JSON API
      and Google HTTP Java client.
      Except Android development there were Python projects, for example,
      an async XML-RPC web-server using Twisted and Wokkel. \\

      Open source is fun for me, I like GitHub and I am not shy to prepare
      small or large patches. Basically they are just refactoring like
      \href{https://github.com/square/fest-android/commits?author=ming13}{Android FEST},
      \href{https://github.com/jdamcd/musicbrainz-android/commits?author=ming13}{MusicBrainz for Android},
      \href{https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/q/owner:%22Artur+Dryomov%22+status:closed,n,z}{LibreOffice Imrpess Remote},
      but I have done major improvements as well:
      \href{https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-mongodb-book/pull/16}{The Little MongoDB PDF building},
      \href{https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/pulls/ming13?state=closed}{Crouton’s sliding animations and Maven support}.

    Polotsk State University, Belarus (2009~--- \dots) \\
    Computer Science

  \section*{Personal}

    \subsection*{Brief}

      Hard-working and explorative. My interests are:
      mobile application development, UI design, UNIX-like
      operating systems.

    \subsection*{In detail}

      Android development is my main specialization. I prefer designing
      applications from scratch on my own following
      \href{https://developer.android.com/design/}{Android design guidelines}
      because other designers prefer to move iOS design elements to Android
      and the result is not so good. Except guidelines I follow Jef Raskin
      and Alan Cooper ideas. For development I use open-source libraries
      stack based on Maven build system (look at
      \href{https://github.com/ming13/gambit}{Gambit’s source code} for example). \\

      I am a big fan of Linux and I use it for many years as
      an only operating system, so any work with UNIX-like operating systems
      would be a great pleasure and productivity boost for me.
      I like automatization everywhere I could do it and I try to optimize
      work process and software as well. \\

      In my free time I enjoy learning new ideas, projects and technologies
      that correlate with my interests and I am ready to work with them.
      If you have any questions to me~--- I am ready to answer.
