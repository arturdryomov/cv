  \section*{Professional Experience}

    \subsection*{Personal Projects}

      \textbf{Bus Time}~--- available \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.ming13.bustime}{on Google Play} \\

        The timetable for the city where I live in as an Android application.
        The very first version hadn’t any ready-to-use information, so the app
        had the ability to edit timetables and sync them via
        \href{https://dropbox.com}{Dropbox}. The current version contains
        all information users need in a pretty form. I designed and developed
        it myself, plus collected information about buses, because Novopolotsk
        doesn’t have any centralized API for obtaining this. \\

      \textbf{Gambit}~--- availabe \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.ming13.gambit}{on Google Play}
        and \href{https://github.com/ming13/gambit}{GitHub} \\

        Android application for learning foreign languages
        (and other things if you want) using flashcards.
        The first version of the application had the ability of
        with \href{https://drive.google.com}{Google Drive} sync, the current version
        doesn’t support it because of API changes. I designed and developed
        it myself too. It is open source, so you could read all the code
        \href{https://github.com/ming13/gambit}{on GitHub} and understand
        how I prefer to organize Android application development in practice.

    \subsection*{University and Freelance Projects}

      The most noticeable course works at the university were
      a \href{https://github.com/ming13/aequatio}{mathematical tool} written
      using C++ and Qt and a RESTful web-server using Python,
      SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL and Flask. \\

      As a freelancer I wrote some Android applications, the last one was
      a client for a hosting provider using their JSON API. Except Android
      development there were Python projects, for example, an XML-RPC
      web-server using Twisted. \\

      I can tell you more if you are interested, so do not hesitate to ask
      questions.

  \section*{Education}

    Polotsk State University, Belarus (2009~--- \dots) \\
    Computer Science

  \section*{Languages}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Russian~--- native.

      \item English~--- fluent in reading and writing, speaking is not my best.

    \end{itemize}

  \section*{Personal}

    \subsection*{Brief}

      Hard-working and explorative. My interests are:
      mobile application development, UI design, UNIX-like
      operating systems.

    \subsection*{In detail}

      Android development is my main specialization. I prefer designing
      applications from scratch on my own following
      \href{https://developer.android.com/design/}{Android design guidelines}
      because other designers prefer to move iOS design elements to Android
      and the result is a crap. Except guidelines I follow Jef Raskin
      and Alan Cooper ideas. For development I use open-source libraries
      stack based on Maven build system (look at
      \href{https://github.com/ming13/gambit}{Gambit’s source code} for example). \\

      I’m a big fan of Linux and I use it for many years as
      an only operating system, so any work with UNIX-like operating systems
      would be a great pleasure and productivity boost for me.
      I like automatization everywhere I could do it and I try to optimize
      work process and software too. Open source is fun for me and
      I don’t hesitate for small or large contributions. \\

      Every free time I enjoy learning new ideas, projects and technologies
      which correlate with my interests and ready to work with them.
      If you have some questions to me~--- I’m ready to answer.
